# Screwy Pirates

## Problem

Five pirates looted a chest full of 100 gold coins. Being a bunch of democratic pirates, they agree on the following method to divide the loot.

The most senior pirate will propose a distribution of the coins. All pirates, including the most senior pirate, will then vote. If at least 50% of the pirates accept, the gold is divided as proposed. Otherwise, the senior pirate is fed to the shark...

How will the gold coins be divided in the end?
