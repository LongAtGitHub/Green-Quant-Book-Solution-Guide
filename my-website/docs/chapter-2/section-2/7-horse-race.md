# Horse Race

## Problem

<p style={{ fontSize: "1.2rem", fontStyle: "italic" }}>

There are 25 horses, each of which runs at a constant speed that is different from the other horses'. Since the track only has 5 lanes, each race can have at most 5 horses. If you need to find the 3 fastest horses, what is the minimum number of races needed to identify them?

## Hints

<details>
  <summary>Hint 1</summary>

  First divide the 25 horses into groups of 5.

  <summary>Hint 2</summary>

  Think about racing the group winners against each other to narrow down the final candidates.

  After identifying the fastest in each group, carefully reason which remaining horses could still be in the top 3.

  Letâ€™s reason through carefully. There are 25 horses, each with a unique speed. Because only 5 can race at once, you cannot directly race them all together. So:
  
  1. **First round (5 races):** Divide the 25 horses into 5 groups of 5, and race each group. Now you know the order within each group (fastest to slowest).
  
  2. **Second round (6th race):** Take the **first place** horse from each group (5 total) and race them. From this race, you know which horse is fastest overall, and you also rank the other 4 group winners against each other.
  
  3. Now think about which horses *could* still be in the top 3. These must come from:
     - The top 3 finishers in the winners' race (since they beat the other group winners)
     - The second and third place horses from the group of the overall winner (since they may only have been beaten by the best)
     - The second place horse from the group of the second overall
     - Possibly the second place horse from the group of the third overall
  
  4. You gather these candidates (at most 5 horses) and run a **final (7th) race** to get 2nd and 3rd place among them.
  
  Therefore, in total, you need **7 races**:
  - 5 races to rank each group
  - 1 winners' race
  - 1 final decisive race among the candidates
