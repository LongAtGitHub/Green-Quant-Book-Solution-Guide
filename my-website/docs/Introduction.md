The Quant Green Companion is a practical supplement to the Quantitative Finance Green Book. While the original book is an excellent collection of challenging problems, many candidates find its explanations too concise and difficult to follow. This companion provides step-by-step solutions, hints, and deeper reasoning to help you truly understand each problem.

Our focus is to guide you through the thought process, not just the final answer â€” making advanced quantitative finance topics more approachable. Whether you are preparing for interviews, reviewing core quant material, or seeking to strengthen your problem-solving skills, this guide is designed to keep you engaged while preserving the rigorous spirit of the Green Book.
