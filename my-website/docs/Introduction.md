# Chapter 1 — Introduction

🚀 **Welcome to the Quant Green Companion!**

The *Quant Green Companion* is a practical supplement to the [**Quantitative Finance Green Book**](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Guide-Quantitative-Finance-Interviews/dp/1438236662) . While the original book is an excellent collection of challenging problems, many candidates find its explanations too concise and difficult to follow.  

This companion provides:
- ✅ Step-by-step solutions  
- ✅ Hints to guide your thinking  
- ✅ Deeper reasoning behind each answer

Our focus is to **teach you the thought process**, not just deliver final answers — making advanced quantitative finance topics more approachable.

Whether you are:
- preparing for interviews  
- reviewing core quant material  
- or strengthening your problem-solving skills

…this guide will help you stay engaged while keeping the Green Book’s rigorous spirit.

> ✍️ *Tip:* I strongly sugggest you to pick up pen and paper and think hard about the questions. But please use the hints and answer key if you get stuck too long.

Happy problem-solving!
